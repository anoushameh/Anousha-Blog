    <div id="intro">I aspire to be the future President of the United States of America! Ha... you thought!
    As a girl who codes, I plan to use my knowledge to combine my interests of business and technology in fields such as social media, fashion, and design. I love to paint in my free time, dance, and make other people laugh. One day, I plan to start a nonprofit to promote a cleaner, greener earth by selling jewelry made from recycled materials. In addition, I want to continue learning how to program and understand software in whatever field I end up in. Even though, I am unsure about exactly what I want to do...I have ideas for my future that revolve around making me and those around me happy.  Also, I love to travel!</div>

    <h1 id="compsci"><strong>Business and Computer Science:)</strong></h1>
    <p>
    Yeah , I thought business and computer science were intimidating too, but they are not. You can do it.
    I know now that I can do it. In high school, I have been taking business classes since I was a freshman,
    and I knew I was interested in the numbers, innovation, and creativity allowed in the industry. This summer
    I was given an amazing opportunity to be in Girls Who Code 2018… now I know I can code!
    <br>And I WANT TO CODE

    <h1 id="art"><strong>Art&Design</strong></h1>
